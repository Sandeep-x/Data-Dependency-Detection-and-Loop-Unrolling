Instruction Formats
MIPS has a floating point coprocessor that operates on single precision (32-bit) and  double precision (64-bit) floating point numbers. This coprocessor has its own registers, which are numbered F0-F31. Because these registers are only 32-bits wide, two of them are required to hold doubles (64-bits). To simplify matters, floating point operations only use even-numbered registers--including the instructions that operate on single floats (32-bits).
Assume a simplified MIPS processor with the following floating point instructions:
add.d  FRdest, FRsrc1, FRsrc2 		Floating Point Addition Double
add.s  FRdest, FRsrc1, FRsrc2 		Floating Point Addition Single
l.d  FRdest, address 			Load Floating Point Double
l.s  FRdest, address 			Load Floating Point Single
s.d  FRsrc, address 			Store Floating Point Double
s.s  FRsrc, address 			Store Floating Point Single
Assume the following integer instructions are available:
add.u  IRdest, IRsrc1, IRsrc2 		Integer Addition (32-bits)
add.i  IRdest, IRsrc1, Immediate 	Integer Addition with Immediate (16-bits)
sub.u  IRdest, IRsrc1, IRsrc2 		Integer Subtraction (32-bits)
sub.i  IRdest, IRsrc1, Immediate 		Integer Subtraction with Immediate (16-bits)
bne  IRsrc1, IRsrc2, Loop 		branch to Loop if IRsrc1!= IRsrc2
beqz  IRsrc1, Loop 			branch to Loop if IRsrc1= 0
lw  IRdest, address 			Load Integer Word
sw  IRsrc, address 			Store Integer Word
mv  IRdest, IRsrc 			Integer data movement
or  IRdest, IRsrc1, IRsrc2 		Integer OR operation (32-bits)

The addresses mentioned in the floating point and integer instructions are denoted 
using X(IRsrc) format, where X is an integer (16-bits). Assume the RISC pipeline has two 
forwarding paths: (i) ALU to Decode Unit and (ii) Memory to Decode Unit. In (i) the 
result obtained after the ALU can be used in the Decode stage of the immediate next 
instruction with only one stall and in (ii) the value obtained from the memory can be 
used in the Decode stage of the immediate next instruction with two stalls. 
Additionally, the FP unit has the following delays: (i) FP ALU op to Another FP ALU op 
needs 3 stalls (ii) FP ALU op to Store double needs 2 stalls (iii) Load double to FP ALU 
op needs 1 stall (iv) Load double to Store double has 0 stall.
